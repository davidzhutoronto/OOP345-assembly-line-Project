OOP345 Project ReflectionDavid Zhu2021-04-10There is total three milestones in this project. The first MS mainly focused on utilities, delt with incoming data. Second milestone worked with stations and customer orders. The last milestone wrapped everything up and workstation and linemanager were implemented. I learned container, lambda expression, linkage, algorithms and more throughout this project. This project covered majority of material that I have learnt this semester, and it indeed was a good summarization of oop345. Last but not least, attention to details is very important, as some small logic error can take hours to fix.
